/**
 * Each FiloDB dataset is divided into a fixed number of shards for ingestion and distributed in-memory
 * querying. The ShardMapper keeps track of the mapping between shards and nodes for a single dataset.
 * It also keeps track of the status of each shard.
 * - Given a partition hash, find the shard and node coordinator
 * - Given a shard key hash and # bits, find the shards and node coordinators to query
 * - Given a shard key hash and partition hash, # bits, compute the shard (for ingestion partitioning)
 * - Register a node to given shard numbers
 *
 * It is not multi thread safe for mutations (registrations) but reads should be fine.
 *
 * The shard finding given a hash needs to be VERY fast, it is in the hot query and ingestion path.
  *
  * @param numShards number of shards. For this implementation, it needs to be a power of 2.
