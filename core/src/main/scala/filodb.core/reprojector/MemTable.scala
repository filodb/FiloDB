 * The MemTable serves these purposes:
 * 1) Holds incoming rows of data before being flushed
 * 2) Can extract rows of data in a given sort order, and remove them
 * 3) Can read rows of data in a given sort order for queries
 *
 * The MemTable handles data for a single dataset or projection.  TODO: support multiple projections?
 *
 * Data written to a MemTable should be logged via WAL or some other mechanism so it can be recovered in
 * case of failure.
 *
 * MemTables are owned by the DatasetCoordinatorActor, so writes do not have to be thread-safe.
