   * We need to ensure that the partKey updates are published, before the changes are made in the long-durable store for

   * updates.
   *
   * Why are we not using a separate scheduler for publishing updates ?
   *  Consider the following scenario:
   *  1. lets say for num-group 1, the partKey updates are written to the long-term storage.
   *  2. the updates are waiting to be published because the publishing thread is not yet scheduled.
   *  3. At this time, the pod/node hosting the shard goes down (for deployment, crash etc.)
   *  4. On node startup, the shard will bootstrap from data-store and will skip the kafka offsets with the required
   *     updates.
   *  5. This can lead to missed updates and can result in out-of-sync issues for downstream applications which are
   *     consuming this updates.
   *
   * This is invoked during the flush task of any num-group of the shard.
   * @return Success if all the partKeys are written successfully.
   *         ErrorResponse, otherwise
