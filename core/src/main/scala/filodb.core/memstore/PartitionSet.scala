/**
 * NOTE: This code was lifted from https://github.com/non/debox, all credit goes to the author of that repo
 * for this code other than a few mods specific to our ingest record/partition key stuff.
 *
 * This is a customized version of debox's very fast Set of TSPartitions.  What we needed were custom methods
 * for membership based not on a TSPartition, but on the partition key of incoming ingest BinaryRecords, to
 * match against the partition key of TSPartitions.   Unfortunately the original Set in debox is final, so we
 * have to copy code.  Also, BinaryRecord v2's do not have any Java object instances, so regular hashing and equals
 * methods do not work.
 *
 * We could have used a hack for Set of FiloPartition and wrapped incoming records with a FiloPartition and used
 * the hashCode and equals method of that, but it would result in more allocations, plus getting the hashCode and equals
 * to work properly between different types of BinaryRecords (ingest vs partition) is tricky.
